  <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm Sumaiya Anwar, a passionate and enthusiastic Computer Science student with a strong interest in web development, mobile app development, and creative problem-solving. Currently in my 6th semester, I'm actively building my skill set in frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and exploring frameworks like Flutter and tools like VS Code.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe that technology is not just about coding—it's about creating meaningful experiences. Whether it’s designing a user-friendly interface or writing clean, efficient code, I enjoy turning ideas into real, working projects. Recently, I’ve worked on personal projects like a motivational webpage and a mood-changer app that adapts to user emotions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside my technical skills, I have a growing interest in UI/UX design and prompt engineering. I’m also continuously improving my communication skills, as I believe great developers not only build software—they also share ideas clearly and collaborate effectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my free time, I love learning new tools, experimenting with animations, and participating in online challenges and competitions that help me grow. I’m always eager to learn, take on challenges, and work on projects that make a difference.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently open to internships, freelance opportunities, and collaborations where I can contribute, learn, and grow as a developer. Let's build something amazing together!
  </p>
